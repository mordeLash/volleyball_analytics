    Resolves the absolute path to an internal resource for both dev and production.

    This function handles the path discrepancy created when bundling a Python app into 
    a single-file executable. In production (PyInstaller), assets are extracted to 
    a temporary folder. In development, assets reside in the project's root directory.

    Args:
        relative_path (str): The path to the asset relative to the project root 
            (e.g., 'models/ball_detection/model.xml').

    Returns:
        str: The absolute filesystem path to the requested resource.
